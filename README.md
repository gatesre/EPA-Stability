## Summary

This project already has a published abstract 3 years ago. Now, we are revisiting the manuscript and aim to publish a manuscript based on the abstract.

Abstract

> The American Board of Surgery (ABS) Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) pilot study asks faculty to rate the entrustability of surgical trainees across multiple phases of care for a single disease process. It is unknown if faculty do assess trainees in each of those phases and, when they do, if additional information is gleaned. This study aims to address those questions.

To what degree the 3-phase ratings for the same case contribute any variance to the rating outcomes.
